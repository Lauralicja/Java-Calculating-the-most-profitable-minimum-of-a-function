# Java-Calculating-the-most-profitable-minimum-of-a-function
Java project of a program calculating the minimum for functions with many unknown variables.

This is a project created for AGH University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Electrical Engineering,
Automatics, Computer Science and Biomedical Engineering, for 2nd year of Computer science - Operations research and Computational 
complexity theory classes.

This program calculates the most profitable minimum for a function with many unknown variables - x's.
It reads two inequality functions (both of them must be fulfilled) and the minimum function from file, then it 
calculates the best profit to make the outcome as minimal as possible.
